Pav bhaji is a popular Indian street food from Mumbai consisting of a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with soft
bread rolls (pav). The dish is made from a spicy mix of mashed vegetables, often including potatoes, tomatoes, peas, and
cauliflower, cooked in a rich gravy and served with buttered and toasted pav buns. It is a flavorful and hearty meal
known for its savory, tangy, and spicy taste, often garnished with chopped onions, a squeeze of lemon, and fresh
cilantro</p>
